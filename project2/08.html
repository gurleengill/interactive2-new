		<h2>Paul Eluard LADY LOVE</h2>

		<p>She is standing on my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lids And her hair &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine


		She is the form of my&nbsp;&nbsp; hands And the color&nbsp; of&nbsp; my eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; She is swallowed in my shadow Like a stone against the sky

		Her <p>eyes are always open</p> And she does</p> not let me s&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;p In the <p>light</p> of day her dreamsMake <p>suns <br>evaporate,<br>


		Make me <em>laugh, cry and laugh,</em>

		And <b>speak</b> when I have</p> <b>nothing to say.</b>
