		<p>LADY LOVE </p><br>

		She is standing on my <p>l</p><p>i</p><p>d</p><p>s</p>
		And her <p>hair is in </p>
		<p>mine</p>
		She is the <p>form</p> of my <p>hands</p>
		And the color of my eyes,
		She is <p>swallowed</p> in my shadow <br> <br>
		Like a stone against the sky

		Her eyes are always <p>open</p> <br>
		And she does not let me sleep
		In the <p>light</p> of day her dreams
		Make suns <p>evaporate,</p> <br> <br>
		Make me laugh, cry and laugh, 
		And speak when<br> I have nothing<br> to say<br>.
