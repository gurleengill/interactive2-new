		<h1>Paul Eluard</h1>


		<h2>LADY LOVE</h2>


		<p>She is <b>standing</b> on

		my <em>lids</em> And her

		hair is in <em>mine </em>
		She <b>is</b> the form


		of my hands And</p>
		the color of my <em>eyes,</em>
		She is swallowed in

		<p>my <b>shadow</b> Like a


		<em>stone against the sky</em>
		Her <b>eyes</b> are <em>always</em></p>


		open And she <b>does</b>

		<p>not let me sleep

		In the light of

		day <em>her dreams</em> Make

		suns evaporate, <b>Make me</p>
		laugh, cry and laugh, </b>
		<p>And <em>speak</em> when 

		I have <b>nothing</b> to <em>say.</em>
</p>
