		<p>LADY LOVE</p>
<p>She is standing on my lids And her hair is in mine

She is the form of my hands</p>
And the color of my eyes, She is swallowed in my shadow Like a stone against the sky</p>

<p>Her eyes are always open
And she does not let me sleep In the light of day her dreams Make suns evaporate,</p>

<p>Make me laugh, cry and laugh, 

And speak when I     have   nothing   to   say.</p>
Paul Eluard</div>
