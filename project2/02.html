		<p>Paul Eluard </p>

		LADY LOVE <br>

		She is standing on my lids
		And her hair is in mine
		<p>She is the form of my hands
		</p>And the color of my eyes,
		She is swallowed in my shadow
		Like a stone against the sky

		Her <p>eyes are always open</p>
		And she does not let me sleep
		In the light of day her dreams
		Make <p>suns evaporate,</p>
		Make me laugh, cry and laugh, 
		And <p>speak</p> when I have nothing to <p>say.</p>
