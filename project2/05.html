		Paul Eluard <br>


		LADY LOVE <br>

		<p>She is </p>
		<p>standing</p> on my 
		lids And her hair is in 
		<p>mine</p> <br><br> She is the 
		form of my 
		hands And <p>the color of my eyes,<p><br> She is <p>swallowed</p><br> in my 
		shadow<br> Like a stone against the sky Her eyes are always <p>open</p><br> And she does not <p>let me</p><br> 
		sleep In the light of day her dreams <p>Make suns 
		evaporate,</p><br> Make me laugh, 
		cry

		and laugh, <p>And speak 
		when</p><br> I have nothing to say.
