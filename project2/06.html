		<h6>Paul Eluard LADY LOVE</h6>
	<p>She is standing on my lids And her hair is in mine</p> <br>

	<p>She is the<em> form</em> of my hands
	And the color of my eyes, She is swallowed in my shadow Like a <e>stone against the sky</em></p>

	<p>Her eyes are always open
	And she does not let me sleep In the light of day her dreams<em>Make suns evaporate,</em></p><br>

	<p>Make me <em>laugh, </em>cry and laugh, </p>

	<p>And speak when I     have   <h1>nothing </h1>  to   say.</p><br>
