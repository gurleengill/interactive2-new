		LADY LOVE

		<p>She is standing on my lids
		And her hair is in mine</p>
		She is the form of my hands
		<p>And the color of my eyes,
		She is swallowed in my shadow
		Like a stone against the sky</p>

		Her eyes are always open
		<p>And she does not let me sleep
		In the light of day her dreams
		Make suns evaporate,</p>
		Make me laugh, cry and laugh, <br> <br>
		<p>And speak when I &nbsp; &nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; to &nbsp;&nbsp;say.</p>
