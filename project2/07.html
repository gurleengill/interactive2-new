		<h1>Paul Eluard</h1> <br>
		<h3> LADY LOVE </h3>
She is <b>standing</b> on my lids And her <em>hair is in mine</em>


She is the &nbsp;&nbsp;form of my&nbsp;&nbsp; hands And the color of my eyes, She is <b>swallowed</b> in my&nbsp;&nbsp; shadow Like a stone against the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sky

Her eyes are&nbsp;&nbsp; always open&nbsp;&nbsp; And she does not let me sleep In the light of day her dreams Make suns evaporate,


Make me laugh,&nbsp;&nbsp; cry &nbsp;&nbsp;and laugh,

And &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>speak</em> when I have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing to say.
