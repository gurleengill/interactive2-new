		<p>Paul Eluard </p>

		<p>LADY LOVE </p>

		She is <br>standing on my <br>lids And her hair is in <br>mine
		She is the <br>form of my <br>hands

	And the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my eyes, She is swallowed in my <br>shadow Like a stone against the sky Her
	eyes are always open

	And she does not let me <br>sleep In the light of day her dreams Make
	suns <br>evaporate,

	Make me laugh, <br><p>cry</p> and laugh, And
	speak
	<br>
	when I have nothing to
	say.
