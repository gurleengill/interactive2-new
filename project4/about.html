                        <p>Stress and other factors can rapidly increase our heart rates along with the influence of diseases that come with age. Exercise and wellness can be hard for many to integrate into everyday life, but thereâ€™s another way to increase the longevity of your life without any exercise.We have a comprehensive archive of words that, if interacted with consistently each day, can lower your heart rate, effectively lengthening your life in the long run, as long as the instructions below are followed.</p>
                       
                     
                        <p>BBy following a simple set of instructions each day, you will be able to effectively reduce your heart rate, promoting a healthier you, especially in times of stress and high tension. It is simple and easy to implement, you just need to be consistent and use a different word from the list everyday. You can read the word of the day or choose one from the previous lists found in the archive. Scientific research explored breakthroughs in this area and found that by activating and stimulating our brain by interacting with these uncommon words, we are using different parts of our brain that aren't usu sally used and are using a higher percentage of our brain overall. Using these different parts of our brain induces an almost sedative effect and causes our heart rates to lower when we engage these parts of our brain, such as when one interacts with these complex words.

                        <p>We encourage people of all ages to try this out, as it can benefit anyone in the long run.</p>
