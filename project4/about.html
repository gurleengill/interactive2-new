                        <p>By following a simple set of instructions each day, you will be able to effecitvely reduce your heart rate, promoting a healthier you, especially in times of stress and high tension. Scienctific research explored breakthrughs in this area and found that by activating and stimulating our brain by interacting with these uncommon words, we are using diferent parts of our brain that arent ususally used and are using a higher percentage of our brain overall. Using these different parts of our brain induces an almost sedative effect and causes our heart rates to lower when we engage these parts of our brain, such as when one interacts with these compelx words. </p>
                        <p>We encourage people of all ages to try this out, as it can benefit anyone in the long run.</p>
