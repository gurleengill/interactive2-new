	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<h3>Part 1:</h3>
		<ol>

				<li>
				<b>Look presentable.</b> If you look like you're classy and carry yourself with admirable grace and style, people will admire you verbally behind your back.</li>
				<img src="images/2.jpg"> <br> <br>
				<li><b>Talk politely. </b>Use "I am sorry" and "Thank you" wherever need is required. Be soft-spoken, and smile when you talk to people. Also, make eye contact.</li>

				<div id="step26">
					<h3>Part 2:</h3>
					<ol>
				<img src="images/4.jpg"> <br> <br>
				<li>
				<b>Change your style from day to day.</b> Try new hairstyles, new clothes, new shoes and new accessories.</li>
				<img src="images/5.jpg"> <br> <br>
				<li><b>Compliment people.</b> Few sweet words like, "You look nice today" or "Your hair today is awesome" or "Hey, I love your shoes" will make people like you better and they are most likely to admire you even more.</li>
				<img src="images/6.jpg"> <br> <br>
				<li><b>Do not misbehave with anyone.</b> Even when you smell a quarrel, avoid it. Stay silent, remember how you have to act. Impress people with your values and manners.</li>
			</div>

		</ol>
		<h3><em>Tips</em></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Set your personality. Don't be that someone who does what their friends do; be your own person.</li>
			<li>Also, sometimes keep to yourself. But only sometimes. That way, you will appear mysterious, charming and very different.</li>
			<li>Put on aromatic perfume, like lavender or cinnamon. Remember, you have to smell irresistibly good.</li>
			<li>Look approachable, don't slouch, keep your posture and smile - Try not to talk too much, and be polite all the time.</li>
			<li>Don't approach anyone to introduce yourself. However, when someone comes to you and you sense small talk, be very polite and talk like you're friends already.</li>
			<li>Enhance your features. Use eyelash-curlers and kohl. And foundation and a little blush, if you'd like.</li>

		</ul>
		<h3><em>Warnings</em></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not boast.</li>
			<li>Don't ever speak loudly.</li>

		</ul>
